        Angkor Wat was built at the behest of the Khmer king Suryavarman II in
        the early 12th century in Ya≈õodharapura (present-day Angkor), the
        capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum.
        Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the
        temple-mountain and the later galleried temple. It is designed to
        represent Mount Meru, home of the devas in Hindu mythology and is
        surrounded by a moat more than 5 km (3.1 mi). Enclosed within an outer
        wall 3.6 kilometres (2.2 mi) long are three rectangular galleries, each
        raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of
        towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the
        west with scholars divided as to the significance of this.
